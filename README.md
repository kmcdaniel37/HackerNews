# HackerNews


Use https://github.com/HackerNews/API to generate a modern, web-based solution using C# and .NET Core that displays the title and author of the newest stories on Hacker News. 

Angular 7
Material UI
.Net Core 2.0

There should be tests. It should compile and run. The title should take you to the article.

If you have time, try some of the bonuses:

·         Add a search function.

·         Build caching. 

·         Put it on Azure 
 

Ensure that Appseting.json in the HackerNew.Web is set to the base url of the API (HackerNewSApiUri)
